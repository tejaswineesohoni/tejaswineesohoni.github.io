For coreferencing, I used the Stanford NLP library. This library provides a module for coreferencing. While it is not very easy to figure out its usage, it turns out that this module works quite well once one can figure it out. I used some sentences from a parsed Wikipedia page that is used by the actual TextJoiner system. The article I used was about Chicago. I used this module to clean the text, tokenize it, and annotate it. This is then used to build a parse tree of the current sentence and its corresponding dependency graph. Using this, I build a coreference link graph of chains, where each chain stores the mentions of a particular entity.
