		On the labeled dataset, I ran 5 algorithms, all with 10-fold cross validation. They gave different levels of accuracy, as shown below.
		<ol>
		<li>J48 (Decision Tree)- 90.4762% accuracy</li>
		<li>Random Forest - 89.1156% accuracy</li>
		<li>IBk (k Nearest Neighbors) - 85.034% accuracy</li>
		<li>Naive Bayes - 79.932% accuracy</li>
		<li>Multilayer Perceptron - 95.2531% accuracy</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<strong>
	From the above data, I think Multilayer Perceptron, followed by Decision Tree, is the best algorithm to see whether the predictions made by the Stanford library are accurate.
